the generous technical and spiritual help of Einstein and the Deacon. They represent what is best about Miami cops, and they taught me some of what it means to do this very tough job in a tougher place.</p>
			<p class="tx">I would also like to thank a number of people who made some very helpful suggestions, especially my wife, the Barclays, Julio S., Dr. and Mrs. A. L. Freundlich, Pookie, Bear, and Tinky.</p>
			<p class="tx">I am deeply indebted to Jason Kaufman for his wisdom and insight in shaping the book.</p>
			<p class="tx">Thanks also to Doris, the Lady of the Last Laugh.</p>
			<p class="tx">And very special thanks to Nick Ellison, who is everything an agent is supposed to be but almost never is.</p>
