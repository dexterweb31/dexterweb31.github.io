			<p class="cn"><b>TWENTY-SIX</b></p>
			<p class="cotx1"><span class="ic"><b>I</b></span> <small>COULD NOT BE SURE THAT</small> I <small>WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BACK</small> to the party, but I didn’t want to go so far away that I missed the chance to graciously accept my sister’s apology. So I went to loiter just inside the front door of the former Manny Borque’s apartment, where I could be noticed at the appropriate time. Unfortunately, the killer had not stolen the giant artistic ball of animal vomit on the pedestal by the door. It was still there, right in the middle of my loitering grounds, and I was forced to look at it while I waited.</p>
			<p class="tx">I was wondering how long it would take Deborah to ask the old man about the tattoo and then make the connection. Even as I wondered, I heard her raise her voice in official ritual words of dismissal, thanking the old man for his help and instructing him to call if he thought of anything else. And then the two of them came toward the door, Deborah holding the old man firmly by the elbow and steering him out of the apartment.</p>
			<p class="tx">“But what about my paper, miss?” he protested as she opened the door.</p>
			<p class="tx">“It’s Sergeant Miss,” I told him, and Deborah glared at me.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Call the paper,” she told him. “They’ll give you a refund.” And she practically hurled him out the door, where he stood for a moment trembling with anger.</p>
			<p class="tx">“The bad guys are winning!” he shouted, and then, happily for us, Deborah closed the door.</p>
			<p class="tx">“He’s right, you know,” I said to her.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Well, you don’t have to look so goddamned happy about it,” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“And you, on the other hand, might try looking a lot happier,” I said. “It’s him, the boyfriend, what’s his name.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Kurt Wagner,” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Very good,” I said. “Due diligence. Kurt Wagner it is, and you know it.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“I don’t know shit,” she said. “It could still be a coincidence.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Sure, it could be,” I said. “And there’s even a mathematical chance that the sun will come up in the west, but it’s not very likely. And who else do you have?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“That fucking creep, Wilkins,” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Somebody’s been watching him, right?”</p>
			<p class="tx">She snorted. “Yeah, but you know what these guys are like. They take a nap, or take a dump, and swear the guy was never out of their sight. Meantime, the guy they’re supposed to watch is out chopping up cheerleaders.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“So you really still think he could be the killer? Even when this kid was here at exactly the same time Manny was killed?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“You were here at the same time,” she said. “And this one’s not like the others. More like a cheap copy.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Then how did Tammy Connor’s head get here?” I said. “Kurt Wagner is doing this, Debs, he has to be.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“All right,” she said. “He probably is.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Probably?” I said, and I really was surprised. Everything pointed to the kid with the neck tattoo, and Deborah was dithering.</p>
			<p class="tx">She looked at me for a long moment, and it was not a look of warm, loving filial affection. “It still might be you,” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“By all means, arrest me,” I said. “That would be the smart thing to do, wouldn’t it? Captain Matthews will be happy because you made an arrest, and the media will love you for busting your brother. Terrific solution, Deborah. It will even make the real killer happy.”</p>
			<p class="tx">Deborah said nothing, just turned and walked away. After thinking about it for a moment, I realized what a good idea that was. So I did it, too, and walked away in the opposite direction, out of the apartment and back to work.</p>
			<p class="tx">The rest of my day was far more fulfilling. Two bodies, male, Caucasian, had been found in a BMW parked on the shoulder of the Palmetto Expressway. When somebody tried to steal the car, they found the bodies and phoned it in—after removing the sound system and the airbags. The apparent cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds. The newspapers are fond of using the phrase “gangland style” for killings that show a certain neatness and economy. We would not be searching for any gangs this time. The two bodies and the inside of the car had been quite literally hosed with lead and spurting blood, as though the killer had trouble figuring out which end of the gun to hold on to. Judging from the bullet holes in the windows, it was a miracle that no passing motorists had been shot as well.</p>
			<p class="tx">A busy Dexter should be a happy Dexter, and there was enough awful dried blood in the car and on the surrounding pavement to keep me occupied for hours, but not surprisingly I was still not happy. I had such a large number of hideous things happening to me, and now there was this disagreement with Debs. It was not really accurate to say that I loved Deborah, since I am incapable of love, but I was used to her, and I would rather have her around and reasonably content with me.</p>
			<p class="tx">Other than a few ordinary sibling squabbles when we were younger, Deborah and I had rarely had any serious disagreements, and I was a bit surprised to find out that this one bothered me a great deal. In spite of the fact that I am a soulless monster who enjoys killing, it stung to have her think of me that way, especially since I had given my word of honor as an ogre that I was entirely innocent, at least in this case.</p>
			<p class="tx">I wanted to get along with my sister, but I was also miffed that she seemed a little too enthusiastic about her role as a representative of the Full Majesty of the Law, and not quite willing enough as my sidekick and confidante.</p>
			<p class="tx">Of course it made sense for me to be wasting my perfectly good indignation on this, since there was nothing else at all to occupy my attention at the time—things like weddings, mysterious music, and missing Passengers always sort themselves out, right? And blood spatter is a simple craft that requires minimal concentration. To prove it, I let my thoughts wander as I mentally wallowed in my sad state, and because of it I slipped in the congealed blood and went down to one knee on the roadside by the BMW.</p>
			<p class="tx">The shock of contact with the road was immediately echoed by an interior shock, a jolt of fear and cold air going through me, rising up from the awful sticky mess and straight into my empty self, and it was a long moment before I could breathe again. Steady, Dexter, I thought. This is just a small, painful reminder of who you are and where you came from, brought on by stress. It has nothing to do with operatic cattle.</p>
			<p class="tx">I managed to stand up without whimpering, but my pants were torn, my knee hurt, and one leg of the pants was covered with the vile half-dry blood.</p>
			<p class="tx">I really don’t like blood. And to look down and see it actually on my clothes, actually <i>touching</i> me, and on top of the complete turmoil my life had become and the great empty Passenger-less pit I had fallen into—the blood completed the circuit. These were definitely emotions I was feeling now, and they were not pleasant. I felt myself shudder and I nearly shouted, but I managed, just barely, to contain myself, clean up, and soldier on.</p>
			<p class="tx">I did not feel much better, but I made it through the day by changing into the extra set of clothing that wise blood-spatter techs keep handy, and it was finally time to head home.</p>
			<p class="tx">As I drove south to Rita’s on Old Cutler a little red Geo got on my bumper and would not back off. I watched in the mirror, but I could not see the driver’s face, and I wondered if I had done something I wasn’t aware of to make him or her angry. I was very tempted to step on the brakes and let the chips fall where they might, but I was not yet so completely frazzled as to believe that wrecking my car would make anything better. I tried to ignore the other car, just one more semi-insane Miami driver with a mysterious hidden agenda.</p>
			<p class="tx">But it stayed with me, inches away, and I began to wonder what that agenda might be. I sped up. The Geo sped up and stayed right on my bumper.</p>
			<p class="tx">I slowed down; so did the Geo.</p>
			<p class="tx">I moved across two lanes of traffic, leaving a chorus of angry horns and upraised fingers in my wake. The Geo followed.</p>
			<p class="tx">Who was it? What did they want with me? Was it possible that Starzak knew that it was me who had taped him up, and now he was coming after me in a different car, determined to revenge himself on me? Or was it someone else this time—and if so, who? Why? I could not bring myself to believe that Moloch was driving the car behind me. How could an ancient god even get a learner’s permit? But somebody was back there, clearly planning to stay with me for a while, and I had no idea who. I found myself flailing for an answer, reaching for something that was no longer there, and the sense of loss and emptiness amplified my uncertainty and anger and uneasiness, and I realized my breath was hissing in and out between clenched teeth and my hands were clenched on the wheel and covered with a chilly sheen of sweat, and I thought, that’s enough.</p>
			<p class="tx">And as I mentally prepared myself to slam on the brakes and leap out of the car to smash this other driver’s face into a red pulp, the red Geo suddenly slid off my bumper and turned right, vanishing down a side street into the Miami night.</p>
			<p class="tx">It had been nothing after all, just a perfectly normal rush-hour psychosis. Another average crazed Miami driver, killing the boredom of the long drive home by playing tag with the car in front.</p>
			<p class="tx">And I was nothing more than a dazed, battered, paranoid former monster with his hands clenched and his teeth grinding together.</p>
			<p class="tx">I went home.</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p class="tx1">The Watcher dropped away and then circled back. He moved through the traffic invisible to the other now, and turned down the street to the house well behind the other. He had enjoyed tailing him so closely, forcing a display of mild panic. He had provoked the other in order to gauge his readiness, and what he found was very satisfying. It was a finely balanced process, to push the other precisely into the right frame of mind. He had done it many times before, and he knew the signs. Jumpy, but not quite on the ragged edge where he needed to be, not yet.</p>
			<p class="tx">It was clearly time to accelerate things.</p>
			<p class="tx">Tonight would be very special.</p>
