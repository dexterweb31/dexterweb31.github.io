			<p class="cotx11">It is impossible to write in a vacuum. The air for this book was provided by Bear, Pookie, and Tink. My gratitude to Jason Kaufman and his aide de camp, Caleb, for their enormous help in shaping the manuscript.</p>
			<p class="tx11">And as ever, special thanks to Nick Ellison, who made it all happen.</p>
