			<p class="cn"><b>TEN</b></p>
			<p class="cotx1"><span class="ic"><b>T</b></span><small>HE NEXT DAY PASSED UNEVENTFULLY AND WE GOT NO</small> closer to any kind of hint about the two murders at the university. And life being the kind of lopsided, grotesque affair that it is, Deborah blamed our lack of progress on me. She was still convinced that I had special magical powers and had used them to see straight into the dark heart of the killings, and that I was keeping vital information from her for petty personal reasons.</p>
			<p class="tx">Very flattering, but totally untrue. The only insight I had into the matter was that something about it had scared the Dark Passenger, and I did not want that to happen again. I decided to stay away from the case, and since there was almost no blood work involved, that should have been easy in a logical and well-ordered universe.</p>
			<p class="tx">But alas, we do not live in any such place. Our universe is ruled by random whim, inhabited by people who laugh at logic. At the moment, the chief of these was my sister. Late the following morning she cornered me in my little cubbyhole and dragged me away to lunch with her boyfriend, Kyle Chutsky. I had no real objections to Chutsky, other than his permanent attitude of knowing the real truth about everything. Aside from that, he was just as pleasant and amiable as a cold killer can be, and it would have been hypocritical for me to object to his personality on those grounds. And since he seemed to make my sister happy, I did not object on any other grounds, either.</p>
			<p class="tx">So off I went to lunch, since in the first place she was my sister, and in the second, the mighty machine that is my body needs almost constant fuel.</p>
			<p class="tx">The fuel it craves most often is a <i>medianoche</i> sandwich, usually with a side of fried <i>plátanos</i> and a <i>mamey</i> milk shake. I don’t know why this simple, hearty meal plays such a transcendent chord on the strings of my being, but there is nothing else like it. Prepared properly, it takes me as close to ecstasy as I can get. And no one prepares it quite as properly as Café Relampago, a storefront place not far from police HQ, where the Morgans have been eating since time out of mind. It was so good even Deborah’s perpetual grumpiness couldn’t spoil it.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Goddamn it!” she said to me through a mouthful of sandwich. It was certainly far from a novel phrase coming from her, but she said it with a viciousness that left me lightly spattered with bread crumbs. I took a sip of my excellent <i>batido de mamey</i> and waited for her to expand on her argument, but instead she simply said it again. “Goddamn it!”</p>
			<p class="tx">“You’re covering up your feelings again,” I said. “But because I am your brother, I can tell something is bothering you.”</p>
			<p class="tx">Chutsky snorted as he sawed at his Cuban steak. “No shit,” he said. He was about to say more, but the fork clamped in his prosthetic left hand slipped sideways. “Goddamn it,” he said, and I realized that they had a great deal more in common than I had thought. Deborah leaned over and helped him straighten the fork. “Thanks,” he said, and shoveled in a large bite of the pounded-flat meat.</p>
			<p class="tx">“There, you see?” I said brightly. “All you needed was something to take your mind off your own problems.”</p>
			<p class="tx">We were sitting at a table where we had probably eaten a hundred times. But Deborah was rarely troubled by sentiment; she straightened up and slapped the battered Formica tabletop hard enough to make the sugar bowl jump.</p>
			<p class="tx">“I want to know who talked to that asshole Rick Sangre!” she said. Sangre was a local TV reporter who believed that the gorier a story was, the more vital it was for people to have a free press that could fill them in on as many gruesome details as possible. From the tone of her voice, Deborah was apparently convinced that Rick was my new best friend.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Well, it wasn’t me,” I said. “And I don’t think it was Doakes.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Ouch,” said Chutsky.</p>
			<p class="tx">“<i>And</i>,” she said, “I want to find those fucking heads!”</p>
			<p class="tx">“I don’t have them, either,” I said. “Did you check lost and found?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“You know something, Dexter,” she said. “Come on, why are you holding out on me?”</p>
			<p class="tx">Chutsky looked up and swallowed. “Why should he know something you don’t?” he asked. “Was there a lot of spatter?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“No spatter at all,” I said. “The bodies were cooked, nice and dry.”</p>
			<p class="tx">Chutsky nodded and managed to scoop some rice and beans onto his fork. “You’re a sick bastard, aren’t you?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“He’s worse than sick,” Deborah said. “He’s holding out something.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Oh,” Chutsky said through a mouthful of food. “Is this his amateur profiling thing again?” It was a small fiction; we had told him that my hobby was actually analytical, rather than hands-on.</p>
			<p class="tx">“It is,” Deborah said. “And he won’t tell me what he’s figured out.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“It might be hard to believe, Sis, but I know nothing about this. Just…” I shrugged, but she was already pouncing.</p>
			<p class="tx">“What! Come on, please?”</p>
			<p class="tx">I hesitated again. There was no good way to tell her that the Dark Passenger had reacted to these killings in a brand-new and totally unsettling way. “I just get a feeling,” I said. “Something is a little off with this one.”</p>
			<p class="tx">She snorted. “Two burned headless bodies, and he says something’s a little off. Didn’t you used to be smart?”</p>
			<p class="tx">I took a bite of my sandwich as Deborah frittered away her precious eating time by frowning. “Have you identified the bodies yet?” I asked.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Come on, Dexter. There’s no heads, so we got no dental records. The bodies were burned, so there’s no fingerprints. Shit, we don’t even know what color their hair was. What do you want me to do?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“I could probably help, you know,” Chutsky said. He speared a chunk of fried <i>maduras</i> and popped it into his mouth. “I have a few resources I can call on.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“I don’t need your help,” she said and he shrugged.</p>
			<p class="tx">“You take Dexter’s help,” he said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“That’s different.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“How is that different?” he asked, and it seemed like a reasonable question.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Because he gives me <i>help</i>,” she said. “You want to solve it for me.”</p>
			<p class="tx">They locked eyes and didn’t speak for a long moment. I’d seen them do it before, and it was eerily reminiscent of the nonverbal conversations Cody and Astor had. It was nice to see them so clearly welded together as a couple, even though it reminded me that I had a wedding of my own to worry about, complete with an apparently insane high-class caterer. Happily, just before I could begin to gnash my teeth, Debs broke the eerie silence.</p>
			<p class="tx">“I won’t be one of those women who needs help,” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“But I can get you information that you can’t get,” he said, putting his good hand on her arm.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Like what?” I asked him. I’ll admit I had been curious for some time about what Chutsky was, or had been before his accidental amputations. I knew that he had worked for some government agency which he referred to as the OGA, but I still didn’t know what that stood for.</p>
			<p class="tx">He turned to face me obligingly. “I have friends and sources in a lot of places,” he said. “Something like this might have left some kind of trail somewhere else, and I could call around and find out.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“You mean call your buddies at the OGA?” I said.</p>
			<p class="tx">He smiled. “Something like that,” he said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“For Christ’s sake, Dexter,” Deborah said. “OGA just means other government agency. There’s no such agency, it’s an in-joke.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Nice to be in at last,” I said. “And you can still get access to their files?”</p>
			<p class="tx">He shrugged. “Technically I’m on convalescent leave,” he said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“From doing what?” I asked.</p>
			<p class="tx">He gave me a mechanical smile. “You don’t really want to know,” he said. “The point is, they haven’t decided yet whether I’m any fucking good anymore.” He looked at the fork clamped in his steel hand, turning his arm over to see it move. “Shit,” he said.</p>
			<p class="tx">And because I could feel that one of those awkward moments was upon us, I did what I could to move things back onto a sociable footing. “Didn’t you find anything at the kiln?” I asked. “Some kind of jewelry or something?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“What the fuck is that?” she said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“The kiln,” I said. “Where the bodies were burned.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Haven’t you been paying attention? We haven’t found where the bodies were burned.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Oh,” I said. “I assumed it was done right there on campus, in the ceramic studio.”</p>
			<p class="tx">By the suddenly frozen look on her face, I realized that either she was experiencing massive indigestion or she did not know about the ceramic studio. “It’s just half a mile from the lake where the bodies were found,” I said. “You know, the kiln. Where they make pottery?”</p>
			<p class="tx">Deborah stared at me for a moment longer, and then jumped up from the table. I thought it was a wonderfully creative and dramatic way to end a conversation, and it took a moment before I could do more than blink after her.</p>
			<p class="tx">“I guess she didn’t know about that,” Chutsky said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“That’s my first guess,” I said. “Shall we follow?”</p>
			<p class="tx">He shrugged and speared the last chunk of his steak. “I’m gonna have some flan, and a <i>cafecita</i>. Then I’ll get a cab, since I’m not allowed to help,” he said. He scooped up some rice and beans and nodded at me. “You go ahead, unless you want to walk back to work.”</p>
			<p class="tx">I did not, in fact, have any desire to walk back to work. On the other hand, I still had almost half a milk shake and I did not want to leave that, either. I stood up and followed, but I softened the blow by grabbing the uneaten half of Deborah’s sandwich and taking it with me as I lurched out the door after her.</p>
			<p class="tx">Soon we were rolling through the front gate of the university campus. Deborah spent part of the ride talking on the radio and arranging for people to meet us at the kilns, and the rest of the ride clenching her teeth and muttering.</p>
			<p class="tx">We turned left after the gate and headed down the winding road that leads to the ceramic and pottery area. I had taken a class in pottery there my junior year in an effort to widen my horizons, and found out that I was good at making very regular-looking vases but not terribly successful at creating original works of art, at least not in that medium. In my own area, I flatter myself that I can be creative, as I had recently demonstrated with Zander.</p>
			<p class="tx">Angel-no-relation was already there, carefully and patiently looking through the first kiln for any sign of practically anything. Deborah went over and squatted beside him, leaving me alone with the last three bites of her sandwich. I took the first bite. A crowd was beginning to gather by the yellow tape. Perhaps they were hoping to see something too terrible to look at: I never knew why they gathered like that, but they always did.</p>
			<p class="tx">Deborah was now on the ground beside Angel, who had his head inside the first of the kilns. This would probably be a long wait.</p>
			<p class="tx">I had barely put the last bite of sandwich into my mouth when I became aware that I was being watched. Of course I was being <i>looked at</i>, anyone on the business side of the yellow tape always was. But I was also being <i>watched</i>—the Dark Passenger clamored at me that I had been singled out by something with an unhealthy interest in special wonderful me, and I did not like the feeling. As I swallowed the last of the sandwich and turned to look, the whisper inside me hissed something that sounded like confusion…and then settled into silence.</p>
			<p class="tx">And as it did I felt again the wave of panicked nausea and the bright yellow edge of blindness, and I stumbled for a moment, all my senses crying out that there was danger but my ability to do anything about it completely gone. It lasted only a second. I fought my way back to the surface and looked harder at my surroundings—nothing had changed. A handful of people stood looking on, the sun shone brightly, and a gentle wind riffled through the trees. Just another perfect Miami day, but somewhere in paradise the snake had reared its head. I closed my eyes and listened hard, hoping for some hint about the nature of the menace, but there was nothing but the echo of clawed feet scrabbling away.</p>
			<p class="tx">I opened my eyes and looked around again. There was a crowd of perhaps fifteen people pretending not to be fascinated by the hope of seeing gore, but none of them stood out in any way. None of them were skulking or staring evilly or trying to hide a bazooka under their shirt. In any normal time, I might have expected my Passenger to see a dark shadow around an obvious predator, but there was no such assistance now. As far as I could see, nothing sinister loomed in the crowd. So what had set off the Passenger’s fire alarm? I knew so little about it; it was just there, a presence filled with wicked amusement and sharp suggestions. It had never showed confusion before, not until it saw the two bodies by the lake. And now it was repeating its vague uncertainty, only half a mile from the first spot.</p>
			<p class="tx">Was it something in the water? Or was there some connection to the two burned bodies here at the kilns?</p>
			<p class="tx">I wandered over to where Deborah and Angel-no-relation were working. They didn’t seem to be finding anything particularly alarming, and there were no jolts of panic roiling out from the kiln to the place where the Dark Passenger was hiding.</p>
			<p class="tx">If this second retreat was not caused by something in front of me, then what caused it? What if it was some kind of weird interior erosion? Perhaps my new status of impending husband-hood and stepfather-ness was overwhelming my Passenger. Was I becoming too nice to be a proper host? This would be a fate worse than someone else’s death.</p>
			<p class="tx">I became aware that I was standing just inside the yellow crime-scene tape, and a large form was lurking in front of me.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Uh, hello?” he said. He was a big, well-muscled young specimen with longish, lank hair and the look of someone who believed in breathing through the mouth.</p>
			<p class="tx">“How can I help you, citizen?” I said.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Are you, uh, you know,” he said, “like a cop?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“A little bit like one,” I said.</p>
			<p class="tx">He nodded and thought about that for a moment, looking around behind him as if there might be something there he could eat. On the back of his neck was one of those unfortunate tattoos that have become so popular, an Oriental character of some kind. It probably spelled out “slow learner.” He rubbed the tattoo as if he could hear me thinking about it, then turned around to me and blurted out, “I was wondering about Jessica.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Of course you were,” I said. “Who wouldn’t?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Do they know if it’s her?” he said. “I’m like her boyfriend.”</p>
			<p class="tx">The young gentleman had now succeeded in grabbing my professional attention. “Is Jessica missing?” I asked him.</p>
			<p class="tx">He nodded. “She was, you know, supposed to work out with me? Like every morning, you know. Around the track, and then some abs. But yesterday she doesn’t show up. And same thing this morning. So I started thinking, uh…” He frowned, apparently at the effort of thinking, and his speech trickled to a halt.</p>
			<p class="tx">“What’s your name?” I asked him.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Kurt,” he said. “Kurt Wagner. What’s yours?”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Dexter,” I said. “Wait here a moment, Kurt.” I hurried over to Deborah before the strain of trying to think again proved too much for the boy.</p>
			<p class="tx">“Deborah,” I said, “we may have a small break here.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“Well, it isn’t your damned pot ovens,” she snarled. “They’re too small for a body.”</p>
			<p class="tx">“No,” I said. “But the young man over there is missing a girlfriend.”</p>
			<p class="tx">Her head jerked up and she rose to standing almost on point like a hunting dog. She stared over at Jessica’s like-boyfriend, who looked back and shifted his weight from foot to foot. “About fucking time,” she said, and she headed for him.</p>
			<p class="tx">I looked at Angel. He shrugged and stood up. For a moment, he looked like he was going to say something. But then he shook his head, dusted off his hands, and followed Debs over to hear what Kurt had to say, leaving me really and truly all alone with my dark thoughts.</p>

			<br/>
			<p class="tx1">Just to watch; sometimes it was enough. Of course there was the sure knowledge that watching would lead inevitably to the surging heat and glorious flow of blood, the overwhelming pulse of emotions throbbing from the victims, the rising music of the ordered madness as the sacrifice flew into wonderful death…All this would come. For now, it was enough for the Watcher to observe and soak in the delicious feeling of anonymous, ultimate power. He could feel the unease of the other. That unease would grow, rising through the musical range into fear, then panic, and at last full-fledged terror. It would all come in good time.</p>
			<p class="tx">The Watcher saw the other scanning the crowd, flailing about for some clue to the source of the blossoming sense of danger that tickled at his senses. He would find nothing, of course. Not yet. Not until <i>he</i> determined that the time was right. Not until <i>he</i> had run the other into dull mindless panic. Only then would he stop watching and begin to take final action.</p>
			<p class="tx">And until then—it was time to let the other begin to hear the music of fear.</p>
